To create a web-version of Battleships.

```

#### Technologies Used
+ Ruby
+ RSpec
+ Sinatra

#### Notes

This is a work in progress. Inspired by a simple tic-tac-toe game written in fully HTML, CSS and Javascript that I found online, I'd like to use Canvas (a new element introduced in HTML5) as my board for this game. However, I don't know Javascript (yet!) so it'll take some time before I can complete this project.
